// file's own comment block up top might otherwise suggest for a "backend
// tool". Two reasons:
//   1. Half of what they search/read (user_quizzes) only ever lives in the
//      browser's localStorage; the server has no access to it and never
//      should (privacy — that data shouldn't need to transit this
//      endpoint just to be searched).

//      client-resolvable without a server round-trip at all — see
//      quizManifest.js's own header comment: this project moved manifest
//      loading off a serverless function specifically because of Vercel
//      Hobby's 12-function cap, and a public RLS SELECT policy already
//      permits the exact reads these tools need directly from the client.
// So these tool schemas exist purely to tell the MODEL what it can ask
// for; chat.js's TOOLS_BY_NAME map below never executes them — the
